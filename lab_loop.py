# LAB_LOOPS

## 1) Using range(),  make a range from 45 to 210, using a for loop iterate over
#  the sequence and print the elements.
#  Skip the number 100 and break the loop at 205

for number in range(45, 210):
    if number == 100:
        continue
    if number == 205:
        break
    print (number)



## 2) Using a while loop and input , do the following :
#- Ask the the user : "what is the product of 7 * 24 ?"
#- check if the answer is right then exit the loop and print "You answered this Question correctly"
#- if the answer is wrong, then print "Your Answer is wrong try again.." and show the user the question again.

user_intpput : str = input("what is the product of 7 * 24 ?" )
while  user_intpput == '168':
     print("You answered this Question correctly")
     break
else:    
    print("Your Answer is wrong try again.. " , "what is the product of 7 * 24 ?")
